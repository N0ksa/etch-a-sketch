# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is the fourth project in The Odin Project tutorial series. It's a fun and interactive web application that combines the concept of a sketchpad with the nostalgia of an Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Skills Gained

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in:

1. DOM Manipulation: Learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update and modify web page content.
2. Event Handling and Capture: Explored event handling techniques to respond to user interactions and capture user input effectively.
